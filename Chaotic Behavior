Chaotic Behavior 


-Vortex Shedding and Formation:
Instead of a smooth, steady flow, intermittent formation and shedding of vortices from the edges of the flat plate (especially at the trailing edge). 
These vortices—may form quasi-periodically, but their exact timing, size, and spacing will vary unpredictably due to the chaotic dynamics.

- Unsteady Lift Force:
Since the lift force in the simulation is approximated by the difference in pressure (or density, in the LBM case) between the bottom and top sides of the plate,  the lift force does not stabilize. 
Instead, it fluctuates wildly over time. Periods of high lift may be interrupted suddenly by drops or even reversals (negative lift), echoing the complex interaction of vortices around the plate.

- Fluctuating Pressure, Momentum, and Mass Flow:
The diagnostic plots—showing time evolution of the Bernoulli-corrected pressure difference, total momentum, and mass flow rate—should display irregular oscillations. The chaotic shedding of vortices causes abrupt changes in local pressure fields that,
in turn, lead to bursts or dips in both the momentum and the mass flow through the designated detection zone. This sensitive variation is a typical sign of a chaotic system where small-scale turbulence translates into large-scale fluctuations.
- Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions:
Due to the inherent chaosity of the system, minute differences in initial conditions (or even small numerical perturbations introduced by the Euler integration) can lead to significantly different vortex patterns over time. 
As a result, even if you run the simulation twice with nearly identical settings, the time series for lift, energy, and other variables might not repeat or converge to a smooth, predictable cycle.

- Irregular Kinetic Energy:
The plot of total kinetic energy (even if computed only within the simulation canvas) is expected to oscillate irregularly as the fluid accelerates and decelerates during vortex formation and dissipation.
There will not be simple periodic energy exchange; instead, there will be bursts of increased energy when vortices are shed, followed by more subdued values as vortices decay or merge.


In summary, the simulation outputs  reveal that the flow around the plate is far from steady. There is a complex, ever-changing pattern in the vorticity field; the lift force 
(and by proxy, the pressure difference across the plate) will vary irregularly; and the associated momentum, mass flow rates, and kinetic energy will all reflect the underlying chaotic behavior.
This variability—where small perturbations lead to significant divergences in the evolution of the flow—is what you expect from a chaotic system and is a key indicator that the simulation captures the turbulent nature of the external flow
