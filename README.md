In this project I explore modeling the chaotic motion of a 2D incompressible and inviscid External flow around a thin Flat plate in Python. It should be noted that these models were optimized to run on a jupyter Notebook.
I use two approaches to model the flow , the first is a popular method Leveraging the Euler form of Navier Stokes and lattice Boltzman Method.
The Second is a Lagrangian based Smooth-particle Hydrodynamic simulation using moving partcle. Both Simulations will output a fluid flow with widgets to define the angle of attack of the flow in addition to time eveolution of Lift force, mass flow rate, momemntum , total kinetic energy.
In Both simulations you should be able to observe "vortex shedding behavior and a non steady Lift force through the plate. Both simulations use a simple euler based integration scheme for simplicity. I explored using a higher order solver for the Lagrangian SPH, 
however the Added compute resources required to run it far outweight the added beneifit.
